What features did you try?
    - curvature (summed absolute value)
        * DISCRETE (2)
        * We determined a threshold by using the provided testFeatures function and looking at the numerical data. We
          set a threshold where the cutoff between text and drawing seemed to be: 0.2.
    - distance from the left side of the canvas (average value)
        * DISCRETE (2)
        * We determined a threshold by using the provided testFeatures function and looking at the numerical data. We
          set a threshold where the cutoff between text and drawing seemed to be: 1500.
    - stroke speed (number of points / length of stroke)
        * DISCRETE (4)
        * We determined a threshold by using the provided testFeatures function and looking at the numerical data. We
          found that there were several cutoff points because text is written at a relatively constant speed, whereas
          drawings can be either very fast or very slow.
