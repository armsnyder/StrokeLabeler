What features did you try?
    - curvature (summed absolute value)
        * DISCRETE
        * We determined a threshold by using the provided testFeatures function and looking at the numerical data. We
          set a threshold where the cutoff between text and drawing seemed to be: 0.2.
    - distance from the left side of the canvas (average value)
        * DISCRETE
        * We determined a threshold by using the provided testFeatures function and looking at the numerical data. We
          set a threshold where the cutoff between text and drawing seemed to be: 1500.



Basic Matrix:
{'text': {'text': 327, 'drawing': 414}, 'drawing': {'text': 734, 'drawing': 540}}

Improved Matrix:
{'text': {'text': 593, 'drawing': 148}, 'drawing': {'text': 1082, 'drawing': 192}}
