What features did you try?
    - curvature (summed absolute value)
        * DISCRETE
        * We determined a threshold by using the provided testFeatures function and looking at the numerical data. We
          set a threshold where the cutoff between text and drawing seemed to be: 0.2.
        * After adding this feature to the provided stroke length feature, results did not improve. The viterbi
          algorithm still highly favored 'drawing' as a label.
